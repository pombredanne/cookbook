# Curry sauce

## About

On Boxing Day, 2012, my mother made a brilliant curry with the leftover turkey. I've sinced used this recipe with all sorts of meat and it's dead easy to do.

If you're starting with fresh meat then brown beforehand.

## Ingredients

* Meat (chicken, turkey, lamb, etc)
* Onion, 1, large, chopped finely)
* Ginger (1 inch, grated)
* Red chilli (1, whole)
* Garlic (4/5 cloves, minced)
* Olive oil (a glug)
* Fresh coriander (a bunch, chopped)
* Cumin (2 tsp)
* Tumeric (1 tsp)
* Paprika (3 tsp)
* Chilli powder (1 tsp)
* Tomato passata (one of those 400g cartons)
* Tomato purée (a splodge)
* Salt + pepper
* Half a cup of water

## Instructions

1. Take a decent sized pan and fry the onions on a medium heat until golden, add the garlic and ginger and fry for a couple of minutes.
2. Add the spices and fry for another couple of minutes. Keep stirring! It'll make a delicious curry paste thing.
3. Add the passata and a splodge of tomato purée. Stir well.
4. Add half a cup of water and the rogue chilli followed by the meat. Stir that all up and cook slowly[^1] until the meat is cooked and soft.
5. Once the curry is cooked, add some lovely chopped coriander.

You really want to let this cook slowly. Nobody likes a burnt curry!
