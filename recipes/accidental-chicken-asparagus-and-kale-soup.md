# Accidental Chicken, Asparagus and Kale Soup

## About

I intended to make a stock out of random ingredients that needed to be cooked, however, I accidently kept added bits and pieces until it was more a soup than a stock. It's worth noting that when I made this, it had to be blended and sieved because the asparagus was too large for a soup. Ideally this won't be the case unless that's how you roll.

## Ingredients

* Chicken breast (3, chopped into inch pieces)
* Kale (half a bag)
* Asparagus (2 bunches, chopped into pieces that will fit in your mouth)
* Onion (3, medium, finely chopped)
* Fresh rosmary (1 stick, chopped)
* Fresh thyme (a handful, chopped)
* Fresh coriander (a handful, chopped)
* Dried Oregano (a teaspoon)
* Dried Basil (a teaspoon)
* Bay leaf (1, decent size)
* Garlic (5 cloves, finely chopped)
* Dried red chilli (1)
* Vegetable stock cube
* Tin of chopped tomatoes (1/2 a tin)


## Step 1: Prepare the chicken

0. The idea here is that you fry the chicken breasts with some delicious spices that you like. I used Cajun seasoning with some finely chopped coriander.
1. Whack some olive oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken until its golden.

## Step 2: Add all the things

1. In a large pan, add the chicken, kale, asparagus, onion, herbs, garlic, chilli, the stock cube and the chopped tomatoes.
2. Let it simmer for 2 hours or so with the lid on until the chicken is lovely and soft -- it should break apart with little resistance.
